The "Mplayer" music player app is an Android application designed using React Native, a popular framework for building cross-platform mobile apps using JavaScript and React. This app focuses on providing a seamless experience for users to access and play music stored locally on their devices. Unlike other music players that may stream music or access online libraries, Mplayer specifically fetches and organizes music files already present in the device's storage, such as MP3 and WAV files.
