The "Mplayer" music player app is an Android application designed using React Native, a popular framework for building cross-platform mobile apps using JavaScript and React. This app focuses on providing a seamless experience for users to access and play music stored locally on their devices. Unlike other music players that may stream music or access online libraries, Mplayer specifically fetches and organizes music files already present in the device's storage, such as MP3 and WAV files.

The app scans the device's internal storage for music files, automatically categorizing them by metadata such as artist, album, and genre. The user interface (UI) is designed to be intuitive and visually appealing, offering features like playlists, shuffle, repeat, and a robust search functionality to quickly find songs. Mplayer also supports background playback, allowing users to enjoy their music while using other apps. The design leverages React Nativeâ€™s flexibility and performance to deliver smooth animations and transitions, making it user-friendly.

By focusing solely on locally stored music, Mplayer ensures faster loading times and offline availability, catering to users who prefer to manage and listen to their music library without relying on an internet connection.

This is a new React [Native project](https://reactnative.dev/), bootstrapped using [@react-native-community/cli](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started
> **Note:** Make sure you have completed the [React Native-Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

Step 1: Start the Metro Server
First, you will need to start Metro, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```
#using npm
npm start

#OR using Yarn
yarn start
```
Step 2: Start your Application
Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:

For Android
```
#using npm
npm run android

#OR using Yarn
yarn android
```
If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android Emulator shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

Step 3: Modifying your App
Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.

For Android: Press the R key twice or select "Reload" from the Developer Menu (Ctrl + M (on Window and Linux) or Cmd âŒ˜ + M (on macOS)) to see your changes!

# Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰
You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. ðŸ¥³
